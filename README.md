## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Development

I have added a fourth section in HTML. I have created a navigation function that creates a new list to the upper bar whenever a new section is added in the HTML and navigates through the desired section upon selection. Also, a function that detects if a certain section is in view/focus or not for the background animation.
